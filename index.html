            <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
            <p>Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, tricks a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then directed to clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.</p>

            <h2>How to Spot Phishing Emails</h2>
            <p>Phishing emails often appear to come from a well-known organization, such as a bank or credit card company. They usually include a link to a fake website that looks authentic and may ask for personal information, such as a password or credit card number. Here are some tips to help you spot phishing emails:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check the sender's email address. Phishing emails often come from a suspicious or unfamiliar address.</li>
                <li>Examine the email for generic greetings or requests for personal information. Legitimate organizations usually address you by name and never ask for sensitive information via email.</li>
                <li>Look for spelling and grammar mistakes. Legitimate emails are usually well-written and free of errors.</li>
                <li>Hover over links to see the actual URL. Phishing emails often contain links to fake websites.</li>
                <li>Don't click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown sources.</li>
                <li>Be cautious of urgent or threatening language. Phishing emails often try to scare you into taking immediate action.</li>
            </ul>
